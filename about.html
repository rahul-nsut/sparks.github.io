                         <p> We believe that everybody should have a reasonable quality of life.
                           A life in which they need not struggle or suffer to make ends meet.
                           A life that allows one to provide reasonable safety and security to their families and children.
                            A life that one can live with dignity and in their own terms.
                            Hence, you may come forward and donate as much amount as you want.
